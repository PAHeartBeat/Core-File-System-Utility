# iPAHeartBeat File System Utility

## Introduction
Introducing the File Management System

This system has been developed to offer a powerful utility for working with files. It allows you to seamlessly read and write files in both text and byte formats. Additionally, it includes a handy Text Converter that can read CSV and other delimiter-based data and transform it into a nested list format.

In simple terms, this system simplifies the process of handling files, making it easier to work with textual and binary data. Whether you're just starting out in programming or consider yourself a coding expert, this tool will be a valuable asset in your toolkit.

## Unity Package
Our Unity Package is built using .NET Framework 4.71 and C# 10.

**Key Information**:
We've streamlined the process of accessing this package by configuring Unity Packages with Cloud Smith IO. This means that even if you're new to Unity, you can easily incorporate this package into your projects.

### How to Use

Getting started is a walk in the park. Simply add this package to your Unity project's `manifest.json` file. You have two straightforward options to set up the repository in Unity:

#### Using Unity Editor (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Open your project in the Unity Editor.
2. Go to the Edit menu and select Project Settings.
3. In the Project Settings window, click on Package Manager in the left pane.
4. Scroll down to the Scoped Registry section on the right.
5. In the left section, click the plus icon to create a new registry entry.
6. In the right section, fill in the following details:

   - **Name**: "C# Helper package by iPAHeartBeat"
   - **URL**: "https://npm.cloudsmith.io/ipaheartbeat/core"
   - **Scope(s)**: Click the plus icon on the right and add `com.ipaheartbeat`"

7. Close the window and save your project from the File menu.
8. Congratulations! You're now all set to tap into the capabilities of the packages we've created.

#### Modifying manifest.json (Advanced Option)

1. Open your project in Finder (macOS) or Explorer (Windows).
2. Navigate to the Package folder and open `manifest.json` in your preferred code or text editor (it's a JSON file).
3. Look for the `scopedRegistries` entry within the JSON file. If it's empty or missing, don't worry.
4. Add the following JSON data to the `scopedRegistries` array:

```json
{
	"name": "C# Helper package by iPAHeartBeat",
	"scopes": ["com.ipaheartbeat"],
	"url": "https://npm.cloudsmith.io/ipaheartbeat/core/"
}
```

5. Save the file and close it.
6. Open or reopen your Unity project.
7. Voil√†! You're now all set to make full use of the packages we've developed.

After you've set up the registry in your Unity project, locating the packages in the Unity Package Manager under the "My Registry" option is a breeze.

## C# Project
Our primary C# project supports multiple target frameworks, including .NET Framework 4.8, .NET 5.0, and .NET 6.0.

## NuGet Package
We've also made NuGet packages available on Nuget.org, catering to non-Unity .NET projects. These NuGet packages are compatible with multiple .NET Framework versions.
